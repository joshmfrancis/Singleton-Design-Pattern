This is a project from my CSC 285 course, it is meant to be a baseline implementation of the Singleton Design Pattern.

Use Cases:

 - Implementing design patterns that lead to consistent use of the SOLID design principles.

Problems:

 - I do not see any logical errors or runtime errors with my program.
